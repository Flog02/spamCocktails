    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Purpose of Building</h2>
    <p>Building is one of the simplest yet crucial techniques in cocktail-making. It involves assembling a cocktail directly in the glass by layering ingredients in a particular order to create the perfect balance of flavor and texture.</p>
    <p>Unlike stirring or shaking, building requires minimal tools, making it a quick and effective method. It is often used for cocktails that do not require mixing or chilling, and it is the standard technique for drinks like highballs and layered cocktails.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">When to Use the Building Technique</h3>
    <p>The building technique is ideal for:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Simple Cocktails:</strong> Ideal for drinks with only a few ingredients, such as a Gin and Tonic or Rum and Coke.</li>
      <li><strong>Layered Cocktails:</strong> Used for drinks that require distinct layers of different colors or densities, like the Tequila Sunrise or Pousse-café.</li>
      <li><strong>No Mixing Needed:</strong> When ingredients are already balanced or don’t need to be combined thoroughly, such as in spritzes or iced drinks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">The Building Process</h3>
    <p>Building a cocktail is straightforward but requires attention to detail to achieve a balanced flavor. Here’s how to do it:</p>
    <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li><strong>Choose the Glass:</strong> Pick a glass that suits the cocktail. The glass size and shape can affect the final presentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Start with the Base Ingredient:</strong> Begin by pouring the primary spirit or mixer into the glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the Remaining Ingredients:</strong> Layer the other ingredients one by one, pouring gently over the back of a spoon or directly into the drink to preserve layers.</li>
      <li><strong>Ice (If Needed):</strong> Add ice last to avoid diluting the drink too early in the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Best Practices for Building</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Layer with Care:</strong> When building layered drinks, use the correct pouring technique. Pour gently to avoid mixing the ingredients too soon.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that all ingredients are fresh to avoid muddling the flavors in the final cocktail.</li>
      <li><strong>Ice Quality:</strong> If using ice, make sure it’s fresh, clear, and appropriate for the drink type. Large, dense ice cubes work best for slow dilution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Examples of Built Cocktails</h3>
    <p>Building is a common technique for many cocktails. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Gin and Tonic:</strong> A classic highball that’s simply built by adding gin, tonic, and ice to a glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Tequila Sunrise:</strong> A beautiful layered cocktail that’s made by carefully pouring grenadine, orange juice, and tequila into the glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Old Fashioned:</strong> A traditional drink that’s built by muddling sugar and bitters, adding whiskey, and stirring with ice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Simple Yet Essential:</strong> Building is perfect for cocktails that don’t require much preparation, such as highballs or layered drinks.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Balance:</strong> The order of ingredients can impact the final drink’s taste and presentation, so follow recipes carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Perfect for Layered Cocktails:</strong> Building is ideal when you want to create visual layers in your cocktail.</li>
    </ul>
